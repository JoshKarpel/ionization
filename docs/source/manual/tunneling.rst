Tunneling Simulations
=====================

Tunneling models are implemented in the ``tunneling`` submodule.
The name is a slight misnomer - this is really a collection of models that predict the remaining wavefunction based on instantaneous electric field amplitudes.

* ``tunneling`` - ``Simulation`` and ``Specification`` classes for tunneling simulations.
* ``models`` - implementations of various tunneling models. These can also be used with IDE simulations.
