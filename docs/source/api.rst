On Type Annotations
-------------------

``ionization`` has type annotations, but (as yet) we don't use static type checking.
Many types are used throughout the program, but I have no doubt that it wouldn't actually pass something like ``mypy``.
For the moment, the type annotations are meant to help humans, not machines.
